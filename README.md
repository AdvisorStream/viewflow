# Viewflow

The Django extension for perfectionists with yesterdayâ€™s deadlines.

Viewflow provides set of high-level components to build business apps fast. 
Viewflow helps to organize people collaboration workflow, implement CRUD and reporting.

The goad of viewflow is to allow to get ready-to-use application on top of Django as fast as with no-code solution. But allow gracefully replace built-in functionality part-by-part with your custom code.

Viewflow came in two flavors: 
  - Lightweight BSD-licensed library with only un-opinionated base functionality allows to build your own custom solution on top of it.
  - PRO: Commercially supported full-featured extended library allows to buld ready to use apps with few lines of code.

### JSON Storage for Django Models
Keep dumb business data, quick prototyping without DB migrations, replace multi-table inheritance with proxy models.

`viewflow.jsonstore.*` is the set of virtual Django Model fields that stores inside single JSON database column.

```python
from viewflow import jsonstore
from django.db import models

class Employee(models.Model):
    data = JSONField(default={})
    full_name = jsonstore.CharField(max_length=250)
    hire_date = jsonstore.DateField()
```
The result model works like usual django model. All virtual fields are available to construct ModelForms, Viewsets and Admin interfaces.

```python
class EmployeeForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Employee
        fields = ['full_name', 'hire_date', 'salary']

@admin.register(Employee)
class EmployeeAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ['full_name', 'hire_date']
    fields = ['full_name', ('hire_date', 'salary')]
```
