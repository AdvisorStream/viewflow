# Viewflow

The Django extension for perfectionists with yesterdayâ€™s deadlines.

Viewflow provides set of high-level components to build business apps fast. 
Viewflow helps to organize people collaboration workflow, implement CRUD and reporting.

The goad of viewflow is to allow to get ready-to-use application on top of Django as fast as with no-code solution. But allow gracefully replace built-in functionality part-by-part with your custom code.

Viewflow came in two flavors: 
  - Lightweight BSD-licensed library with only un-opinionated base functionality allows to build your own custom solution on top of it.
  - PRO: Commercially supported full-featured extended library allows to buld ready to use apps with few lines of code.
